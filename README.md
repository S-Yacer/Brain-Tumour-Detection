# Brain Tumor Detection using Machine Learning
This repository contains code for a project that explores the use of different machine learning models to detect brain tumors from magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans. The goal is to compare the accuracy of various models, including artificial neural networks (ANNs), convolutional neural networks (CNNs), and some transfer learning models based on pre-trained architectures such as VGG and Xception.

# Project Overview
The following models are implemented and compared in this project:
-Artificial Neural Network (ANN)
-Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
-Transfer learning models based on pre-trained architectures:
-VGG16
-VGG19
-Xception
-ResNet

#Requirements
The code in this repository was written in Python 3.8 and requires the following packages to be installed:
```numpy
pandas
matplotlib
seaborn
scikit-learn
tensorflow
keras
```

You can install these packages using pip by running:
